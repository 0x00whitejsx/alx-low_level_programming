Once upon a time, in the world of programming and learning, there existed a project known as "0x0B. C - malloc, free." This project, carefully crafted and designed by Julien Barbier, carried the weight of 1, and it unfolded its story from January 15, 2024, at 6:00 AM, to January 17, 2024, at 6:00 AM. As the clock ticked, an auto review loomed at the deadline, ready to assess the work of those who dared to take on the challenge.

The essence of this project lay in the realm of memory allocation, a fundamental concept in the programming universe. The protagonist, the budding programmer, was tasked with exploring the intricacies of automatic and dynamic allocation, with a particular focus on the malloc and free functions.

As the journey unfolded, the learning objectives shone brightly on the horizon. The programmer was to grasp the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, understand the purpose and usage of malloc and free, discern the situations calling for the utilization of malloc, and learn the art of using Valgrind to uncover the secrets of memory leaks.

Amidst the requirements and guidelines, the hero (the programmer) found a set of rules to abide by. They were armed with allowed editors such as vi, vim, and emacs, and their code had to pass the strict scrutiny of the Betty style. The landscape demanded that global variables be left behind, allowing only the use of malloc, free, and the trusted _putchar function. The hero was cautioned against the use of forbidden functions like printf, puts, calloc, and realloc.

In their quest, the hero was reminded of the significance of a README.md file at the project's root, narrating the tale of their code. The code, like a well-structured story, had to end with a newline, and each function had to adhere to the limit of five functions per file. The main characters, the function prototypes, were to be introduced in a header file named main.h, which was a crucial element of the hero's journey.

The hero, guided by these rules, embarked on the adventure, understanding that the code they crafted would be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with a set of strict compilation flags ensuring code quality. They realized that success in this quest meant staying true to the learning objectives, abiding by the rules, and crafting a solution that reflected their own understanding and efforts.

As the project unfolded, the hero encountered challenges, faced bugs, and conquered complexities. They delved into the world of memory allocation, wielding malloc and free like tools of magic. The Valgrind served as a watchful guardian, ensuring that the hero's creation did not leak memory, maintaining the integrity of the digital realm.

In the end, the hero emerged victorious, having met the learning objectives and abiding by the strict guidelines. The README.md narrated the story of their code, the main.h showcased the characters (function prototypes), and the code itself stood as a testament to their journey through the world of malloc and free.

And so, the tale of "0x0B. C - malloc, free" became part of the grand saga of programming projects, a chapter in the book of knowledge that the hero carried forward in their quest for mastery in the realm of coding.
