# Project Name
**0x18. C - Dynamic libraries**


##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c).
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.


## Project Description
Learn about what is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it.
What is the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it.
What are the differences between static and shared libraries.
Basic usage `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`.
